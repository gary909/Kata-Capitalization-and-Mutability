    <h1>Capitalization and Mutability</h1>
    <h2>Open the console...</h2>
    <p>
      Your coworker was supposed to write a simple helper function to capitalize
      a <br />
      string (that contains a single word) before they went on vacation.<br />
      <br />
      Unfortunately, they have now left and the code they gave you doesn't work.
      <br />
      Fix the helper function they wrote so that it works as intended (i.e. make
      <br />
      the first character in the string "word" upper case).<br />
      <br />
      Don't worry about numbers, special characters, or non-string types being
      passed <br />
      to the function. The string lengths will be from 1 character up to 10
      characters, <br />
      but will never be empty.<br />
